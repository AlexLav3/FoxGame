# Rpg Fox game  🦊
Personal project, a game in which the player is a fox. 
There are invisible objects that become visible upon interaction after a given clue(this is mechanic to simulate a fox smelling an object to see its path eg. where an animal went); stamina bar and its influence on ability to run, AI animals. 

Player moves using the controller
3D models used were found for free in the Unreal Marketplace

Mainly done using cpp instead of blueprints, where possible. In some cases, a combination of both was necessary. 

Jumping animation was made by me due to not being satisfied with the one found online for free. 

Inventory system in development.
